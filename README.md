#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. Software engineering can be defined as the the systematic application of engineering principles, tools and methods to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems which majorly involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products. Software engineering is important in the technology industry in that it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of life, including commerce, communication, healthcare and entertainment.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. Development of programming languages for example Fortran which enabled programmers to write code in more human-readable syntax making software development more accessible and efficient. This happened in between 1950s-1960s. The advent of structured programming in the 1960s-1970s which emphasized on the use of control structures like loops that improved code clarity, maintainability and reliability. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2001 which revolutionized software development by promoting collaborative and flexible approaches which led to the improvement and adaptability of software engineering practices.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Requirements- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements. Design- Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface. Implementation- Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications. Testing- Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements. Deployment- Releasing the software to production environment (users) or customers. Maintenance- Providing ongoing support, monitoring, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate. Waterfall- Sequential approach with distinct phases. Each phase must be completed before moving on to the next e.g., requirements, flowing downwards like a waterfall. Some examples include: Banking system software scenario where the bank need to develop a new internal software system for managing customer accounts. Requirements will be well-defined and the project will follow a strict sequence because changes are difficult once a phase is completed. Agile- Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. It breaks the development process into smaller iterations. Some examples include: Mobile App Development scenario whereby a startup is developing a new mobile app to connect local service providers with customers on that the app is developed incrementally with new features added based on the user feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team. Software Developer- Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions. Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans. Project Manager- Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)- these are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code example Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA Version Control Systems (VCS)- these are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members for example Git and Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges. Changing Requirements- Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays. Tight Deadlines- Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality. Technical Debt- Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Strategies for overcoming challenges include Effective communication. Agile methodologies. Prioritization of tasks. Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance. Unit Testing- this is testing individual components or modules of software. Integration Testing- this is testing interactions between different components or subsystems. System Testing- this is testing the entire software system as a whole. Acceptance Testing- this is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models. Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. Its guiding AI models selecting the right words to get useful responses from the AI. Its importance include control over output, precision and relevance.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective. Vague prompt "Tell me about marketing." Improved Prompt "Explain three effective digital marketing strategies for a small business looking to increase online sales."

The improved prompt is more effective because it Specifies the Scope- It narrows down the broad topic of "marketing" to "digital marketing strategies," focusing on a particular aspect of marketing. Identifies the Audience- It specifies "a small business," which helps tailor the advice to a specific context rather than providing general information. Defines the Goal- It clarifies the objective as "increase online sales," giving direction to the response and ensuring the advice is relevant and actionable.
